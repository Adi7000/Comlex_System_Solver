Simply put your Augmented matrix under the input section.
Select Number of decimal digits.
Run and see the rref matrix in polar and rectangular.
Also does conversion between polar and rectangular, usage:
    Usage: (change to deg or rad)
        (r, phi) = phasor(complex_num)    
            Output is tuple
        (a + bj) = rectanglar(polar)
            Output is of typle complex
